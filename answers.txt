What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
  A merge is when you create changes for one branch and combine said changes for that branch with another branch. A merge includes all of the values from both branches.
On the other hand, a rebase is when you move the changes from one branch to another branch. The rebase will apply the changes from the new branch to the original branch.

What is a remote repository?
  A remote repository is a version of a project that is not hosted on a local machine but is hosted on servers that are accessible by the internet. 
  You can access this repository from any computer or device so long as you can connect to the server.
