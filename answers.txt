What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
  A merge is when you create changes for one branch and combine said changes for that branch with another branch. A merge includes all of the values from both branches.
On the other hand, a rebase is when you move the changes from one branch to another branch. The rebase will apply the changes from the new branch to the original branch.
